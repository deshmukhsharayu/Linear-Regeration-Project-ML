Linear Regression Project
🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression, one of the simplest and most powerful algorithms in Machine Learning for predicting continuous values.

🎯 Objective

To build a model that learns from given data and predicts outcomes using a best-fit regression line.

🗂️ Dataset

The dataset contains independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target). Example: predicting house prices based on area, bedrooms, etc.

⚙️ Steps Involved

Import required libraries

Load and explore the dataset

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature selection, etc.)

Split data into training and testing sets

Train the Linear Regression model

Evaluate performance using metrics like R² Score and Mean Squared Error

🧩 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn

📈 Results

The model successfully predicts target values with good accuracy and visualizes the regression line fitting the data.
